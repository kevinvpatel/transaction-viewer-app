<h2 >Current Milestone of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana</h2>

<p>Under the country's flagship financial inclusion project Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), initiated by the Modi government about six years ago, now has 40 Crore active bank accounts. There are 40,05 crore beneficiaries of this scheme according to the latest statistic and deposits in Jan Dhan bank accounts surpass Rs 1.30 lac crore. Another achievement reached under the world's biggest initiative for financial inclusion, PMJDY: Cumulative accounts opened under the scheme reach 40 Cr mark. The milestone arrives just ahead of the announcement of PMJDY 's 6th anniversary. The scheme was initiated on 28 August 2014 with the goal of providing the citizens of the country with equal access to banking facilities. Accounts launched under PMJDY are Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) accounts that have added RuPay debit card and overdraft functionality. Maintaining a minimum balance is not required in BSBD accounts.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In consideration of the scheme's stunning success, the government expanded the accident insurance coverage to Rs 2 lakh in 2018, from Rs 1 lakh for new accounts launched after August 28, 2018. In addition, the cap facility for overdraft was doubled to Rs 10,000 too. The Government has also changed the attention from "every family" to "every unbanked citizen."&nbsp;</p>
