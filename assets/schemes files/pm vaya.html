PMVVY, which had originally closed on 31 March 2020, was subsequently renewed by the government until March 2023 for a subsequent 3 fiscal years. In order to invest, one should contact any LIC agent or purchase it directly from the official site of the insurer. PMVVY 's extension will come as a consolation to senior citizens. Reduced pension rates are the main improvement of the latest updated form.</p>
<p>The Updated PMVVY will bear a lower interest rate than earlier on the investment. Unlike in the older edition of PMVVY, the interest rate in the Updated PMVVY will tend to differ based on the fiscal year (FY) in which the funds are invested. The plan is for 10 years and on deposits made in the FY 20-21 until March 31, 2021, the government has decided the interest rate payable on a monthly basis of 7.4 per cent, i.e. 7.66 per cent per annum for the complete term of 10 years. The Government will announce the PMVVY interest rate at the beginning of each FY for investments made in the next two FY, i.e. 2021-22 and 2022-23.&nbsp;</p>
