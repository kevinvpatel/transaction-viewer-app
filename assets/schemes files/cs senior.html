</ul><h2 >Tax implications under SCSS</h2>
<p>Subject to Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, contributions made in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme qualify for income tax deduction benefit up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh.</p>
<p>Interest earned on SCSS is completely taxable but TDS will be applied if the interest amount earned is more than Rs. 50,000 per annum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 >Calculation method of SCSS</h2>
<p>Deposits made to an account of the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme are accrued and paid out quarterly. Such reimbursements are automatically transferred to the savings account carried with the post office / bank, where this savings account has been initiated for senior citizens. Currently, the SCSS interest rate is 7.4 per cent (as of Q1 FY 20-21). Considering you have deposited Rs. 15 lakh (the maximum allowable amount) in SCSS, the maturity value at the end of the tenure will be Rs.20,55,000 (based on the 1-year interest rate =&nbsp; Rs.1,11,000)</p>
<h2 >Tax provisions applicable for deposits and interest under SCSS</h2>
<p>Deposits made under SCSS with other eligible items are liable for deduction under Section 80C up to Rs 1.50 lakh per year. This clause becomes important as other options for seeking tax benefits under Section 80C such as life insurance policy, pension plan payments, EPF account contributions, ULIP etc. are no more satisfactory for senior citizens. And instead of holding the entire Rs 15 lakh sum in a single year, you can distribute the same over the years to reap more tax benefits under Section 80C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interest earned is entirely taxable under SCSS. The bank would subtract tax @ 10 per cent if the interest rate for senior citizen account holders reaches Rs 50,000 in a year. For others, the TDS threshold is Rs.40,000 per annum. A senior citizen can submit Form 15H or 15G in other cases to receive interest without tax deduction in case the interest for the entire year exceeds the TDS threshold. Under this scheme, a senior citizen is allowed to claim a deduction up to Rs 50,000 for interest received by the bank or post office under Section 80 TTB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 >5 Things To Consider Before Investing In SCSS</h2>
<p>Due to the double-dip recession of high inflation followed by falling interest rates, all senior citizens find it tough to reach all ends. The interest rates on fixed deposits provided by banks have dropped to about 6 per cent. The govt-guaranteed Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) provides a safer solution in such a scenario. Only an individual citizen over 60 years under the FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) can set up an account under the SCSS scheme. Both single or a joint account with your spouse only can be opened under SCSS. Since eligibility under this scheme is determined in regard only to the primary holder, a spouse below the age of 60 can also be nominated.</p>
<p>Also, the spouse can open her / his account as the primary holder under SCSS, unless the conditions are met. You can open an SCSS account through any post office or the approved branches of permitted banks. Under SCSS a HUF is not eligible to open an account. This account can be opened for those who have taken voluntary retirement or retired on superannuation between the age of 55 to 60. In such situations, the account must be activated within one month from the date from which the retirement benefits are received. The same can be accessed even after 50 years of age in the case of a retired defence services staff. Deposits made by those under the age of 60 shall be entitled to pension benefits, up to a cap of 15 lakhs.&nbsp;</p>
