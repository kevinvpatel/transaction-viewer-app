Home loans are long term borrowing instruments with a minimum tenure of 5 years and a maximum tenure of 30 years. The tenure offered to you for your personal loan depends on the loan amount that is sanctioned to you by the lender along with other factors.

        <p class="sansserif">


Anyone — whether self employed or salaried individuals/professionals — with a regular source of income can apply for home loans. One must be at least 21 years old when the loan period begins and should not exceed an age of 65 years when the loan ends or at the time of superannuation. This is the generic home loan eligibility criteria and specifics such as the minimum and maximum age limits, minimum income level, etc. may differ from one lender to another.
        </p>
        
                             <h3>Can I apply for a joint loan with my friend?

        <p class="sansserif">
A lender would only allow you to apply for a joint home loan if the application is co-signed by one or more members of your immediate family. Thus, your friend does not qualify.

                                  <h3>Floating rate home loan?

</h3>

        <p class="sansserif">
If the interest rate on the loan varies periodically over the loan tenure, then it is called a floating rate home loan. Lenders have their own base rate which determines the rate of interest charged on a home loan. The base rates of banks are revised from time to time based on RBI directives as well as other factors, which leads to an increase or decrease in the EMI amount payable.

        </p>
        
        
                                          <h3>Fixed rate home loan?


</h3>
        
    
        <p class="sansserif">
Fixed rate home loans are offered at a predetermined interest rate during the loan period and these remain unchanged during the loan period irrespective of market conditions. This can be a huge benefit when market volatility starts affecting interest rates. For instance, if the RBI increases interest rates on loans, then people with fixed rate home loan will not be affected by any increase or decrease in the market interest rates and the EMI amount will remain unchanged. This type of home loan is less popular these days.

        </p>
        
                                                  <h3>MCLR method going to affect my current home loan?


</h3>
      
        
        <p class="sansserif">

As per recently updated RBI rules, banks are required to use the MCLR (Marginal cost of lending rate) method to determine the interest rate on home loans. In case of a floating rate home loan, the banks are now required to change the interest rate either yearly or every six months. In case you have a fixed rate home loan, you can get in touch with your bank to get information regarding conversion of your fixed rate home loan to the new MCLR-based floating interest rate. At present, introduction of the new MCLR regime has led to a reduction in applicable home loan interest rates.

 <h3>Key charges associated with a home loan process?


</h3>
      
        
        <p class="sansserif">

Processing Fee- When applying for a loan, a fee is paid to the lender known as processing fee. The amount paid could be either a percentage of the loan amount or a fixed amount that is paid in lieu of carrying out the loan sanction formalities.
            </p>
        
       <p class="sansserif">     
Commitment Fee- It is essential to avail the loan within a stipulated time period after it is processed and sanctioned otherwise some financial institutions levy a commitment fee. By paying the commitment fee, you are assured that you can access the loan at the interest rate and for the tenure that was initially agreed on. Most banks no longer charge this fee.
           </p>
        
           <p class="sansserif">
Pre-payment Charges- Banks/ financial institutions might charge a penalty if the entire loan amount is paid off before completion of the loan tenure. The penalty amount also known as foreclosure/pre-payment charges could be a maximum of 5% of the loan amount that is paid off before the completion of loan tenure.
               </p>
               
               <p class="sansserif">
Miscellaneous charges- Documentation, stamp duty, credit bureau report issuance charges and consultant charges are generally considered as miscellaneous charges by few lenders.
