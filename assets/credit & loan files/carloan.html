         <h3>Car loan
</h3>
        
        <p class="sansserif">
A car loan is a borrowing instrument that a lender such as a bank or NBFC (non-banking financial company) provides an individual allowing him/her to purchase a car. Car loans have gained popularity in recent times as instead of being a luxury item or a symbol of status, cars have grown to become an essential commodity for the continuously growing middle class of India. With the increased popularity of car loans, most banks and NBFCs currently offer this type of loan to individuals who have a good credit history. One point to keep in mind regarding a car loan is the fact that this loan invests in a depreciating asset i.e. the asset (car) bought using this loan is in fact going to cost less over time.

                 <h3>Can I get a loan to purchase a used car?
</h3>
       
        
        <p class="sansserif">

Yes, car loan is offered for pre-used cars. But, the interest rate for such a loan would differ from that of a new car. However, the loan would only cover the price of the car itself, other costs as transfer of registration, etc. will have to borne by you.
        </p>
        
        
        
                 <h3>Document for car Loan
</h3>
       
        
        <p class="sansserif">
Like any other loan that you apply for, a car loan application requires self attested supporting documents such as income (last three pay slips/last acknowledged ITR), address and identity proof documents along with you PAN card. Other documentation requirements, if any, tend to differ from one lender to another.
        </p>
        
                        <h3>typical tenure of a car loan
</h3>
       
        
        <p class="sansserif">


The tenure of a car loan ranges from 1 year to 5 years. The shorter the loan tenure, the higher is the EMI payable and the reverse is true for longer car loan tenures. Currently, a small number of lenders are engaged in providing car loans for longer durations of up to 7 years.
        </p>
        
                               <h3>In which cases can car loan application be rejected?
</h3>
       
        
        <p class="sansserif">
Your loan application may be rejected if you have a bad credit score, have defaulted on your repayments or applied for and been rejected for loans multiple times, etc. Also, you should meet the bankâ€™s eligibility criteria such as minimum income level, age, previous relationship with the bank, etc. to get your loan approved.
        </p>
         
                                       <h3>Any tax benefits of a car loan
</h3>

        <p class="sansserif">
No. Unlike a home loan, a car loan has no tax savings benefits what so ever. Therefore car loan amounts should always be tied to your actual requirement and splurging on a fancy car by taking a large loan amount is not a good idea.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Diffrence between Fixed rete and Floting rate in car loan</h3>

             <p class="sansserif">
                 In case of a fixed rate car loan, the rate of interest applicable on the car loan remains the same over a period of time. Therefore fixed rate car loans have a specific EMI payout requirement that does not change due to market conditions. In case of a floating rate car loan, the applicable interest rate of the car loan varies periodically as per the decision of the lender. Thus the payable EMI on a floating rate loan may change from time to time.</p>
